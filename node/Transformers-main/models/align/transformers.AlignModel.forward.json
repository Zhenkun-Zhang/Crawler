See PreTrainedTokenizer.encode() andPreTrainedTokenizer.call() for details.What are input IDs?attention_mask (torch.Tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length), optional):Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in [0, 1]:1 for tokens that are not masked,0 for tokens that are masked.What are attention masks?position_ids (torch.LongTensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length), optional):Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings. Selected in the range [0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1].What are position IDs?token_type_ids (torch.LongTensor of shape ({0}), optional):Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs. Indices are selected in [0, 1]:0 corresponds to a sentence A token,1 corresponds to a sentence B token.What are token type IDs?head_mask (torch.FloatTensor of shape (num_heads,) or (num_layers, num_heads), optional):Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules. Mask values selected in [0, 1]:1 indicates the head is not masked,0 indicates the head is masked.inputs_embeds (torch.FloatTensor of shape ({0}, hidden_size), optional):Optionally, instead of passing input_ids you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. Thisis useful if you want more control over how to convert input_ids indices into associated vectors than themodels internal embedding lookup matrix.pixel_values (torch.FloatTensor of shape (batch_size, num_channels, height, width)):Pixel values. Padding will be ignored by default should you provide it. Pixel values can be obtained usingAutoImageProcessor. See EfficientNetImageProcessor.call() for details.return_loss (bool, optional):Whether or not to return the contrastive loss.output_attentions (bool, optional):Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See attentions under returnedtensors for more detail.output_hidden_states (bool, optional):Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See hidden_states under returned tensors formore detail.return_dict (bool, optional):Whether or not to return a ModelOutput instead of a plain tuple."
