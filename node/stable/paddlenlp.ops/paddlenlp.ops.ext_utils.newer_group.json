In other words, if ‘target’ exists and is newerthan every file in ‘sources’, return false; otherwise return true.‘missing’ controls what we do when a source file is missing; thedefault (“error”) is to blow up with an OSError from inside ‘stat()’;if it is “ignore”, we silently drop any missing source files; if it is“newer”, any missing source files make us assume that ‘target’ isout-of-date (this is handy in “dry-run” mode: it’ll make you pretend tocarry out commands that wouldn’t work because inputs are missing, butthat doesn’t matter because you’re not actually going to run thecommands).",
